# Quantization and compilation of the model using TFLite and TVM

Let's consider a simple scenario, where we want to optimize the inference time and memory usage of the classification model executed on a x86 CPU.

For this, we are going to use the [`PetDataset`](https://github.com/antmicro/kenning/blob/main/kenning/datasets/pet_dataset.py) Dataset and the [`TensorFlowPetDatasetMobileNetV2`](https://github.com/antmicro/kenning/blob/main/kenning/modelwrappers/classification/tensorflow_pet_dataset.py) ModelWrapper.

## Prepare environment

First of all, we should install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install "kenning[tensorflow,tflite,tvm,reports] @ git+https://github.com/antmicro/kenning.git"
```

## Train model (optional)

We will skip the training process - we will use [tensorflow_pet_dataset_mobilenetv2.h5](https://dl.antmicro.com/kenning/models/classification/tensorflow_pet_dataset_mobilenetv2.h5).
In Kenning, available models and resources can be downloaded using URIs with the `kenning://` scheme, in this case `kenning:///models/classification/tensorflow_pet_dataset_mobilenetv2.h5`.

The training of the above model can be performed using the following command:

```bash timeout=30
kenning train \
    --modelwrapper-cls kenning.modelwrappers.classification.tensorflow_pet_dataset.TensorFlowPetDatasetMobileNetV2 \
    --dataset-cls kenning.datasets.pet_dataset.PetDataset \
    --logdir build/logs \
    --dataset-root build/pet-dataset \
    --model-path build/trained-model.h5 \
    --batch-size 32 \
    --learning-rate 0.0001 \
    --num-epochs 50
```

## Benchmarking a model using a native framework

At the beginning, we want to check how the trained model performs using the native framework on CPU.

For this, we will use the `inference_tester` scenario.
Scenarios are configured using JSON format files.
In our case, the JSON file (named `native.json`) will look like this:

```{literalinclude} ../scripts/jsonconfigs/mobilenetv2-tensorflow-native.json
:language: json
```

This JSON provides a configuration for running the model natively and evaluating it against a defined Dataset.

For every class in the above JSON file, there are two keys required: `type` which is a module path of our class and `parameters` which is used to provide arguments used to create the instances of our classes.

In `model_wrapper`, we specify the model used for evaluation - here it is MobileNetV2 trained on Pet Dataset.
The `model_path` is the path to the saved model.
The `TensorFlowPetDatasetMobileNetV2` model wrapper provides methods for loading the model, preprocessing the inputs, postprocessing the outputs and running inference using the native framework (TensorFlow in this case).

The dataset provided for evaluation is Pet Dataset - here we specify that we want to download the dataset to the `./build/pet-dataset` directory (`dataset_root`).
The `PetDataset` class can download the dataset (if necessary), load it, read the inputs and outputs from files, process them, and implement evaluation methods for the model.

With the above config saved in the `native.json` file, run the `inference_tester` scenario:

```bash skip
kenning test \
  --json-cfg scripts/jsonconfigs/mobilenetv2-tensorflow-native.json \
  --measurements build/native.json
```

This module runs inference based on the given configuration, evaluates the model and stores quality and performance metrics in JSON format, saved to the `build/native.json` file.
All other JSONs in this example use case can be executed with this command.

To visualize the evaluation and benchmark results, run the `render_report` module:

```bash skip
kenning report \
  --report-path build/benchmarks/native.md \
  --measurements build/native.json \
  --root-dir build/benchmarks \
  --img-dir build/benchmarks/img \
  --report-types performance classification \
  --report-name 'native'
```

Or use the simplified command:

```bash skip
kenning report \
  --report-path build/benchmarks/native.md \
  --measurements build/native.json
```

Moreover, all these commands can be reduced to a single `kenning` run:

```bash name=native
kenning test report \
  --json-cfg scripts/jsonconfigs/mobilenetv2-tensorflow-native.json \
  --measurements build/native.json \
  --report-path build/benchmarks/native.md
```

This module takes the output JSON file generated by the `inference_tester` module, and creates a report titled `native`, which is saved in the `build/benchmarks/native.md` directory.
As specified in the `--report-types` flag, we create `performance` and `classification` metrics sections in the report (for example, there is also a `detection` report type for object detection tasks).

In `build/benchmarks/img` there will be images with the `native_*` prefix visualizing the confusion matrix, CPU and memory usage, as well as inference time.

The `build/benchmarks/native.md` file is a Markdown document containing a full report for the model - apart from linking to the generated visualizations, it provides aggregated information about CPU and memory usage, as well as classification quality metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, precision or G-Mean.
Such file can be included in a larger, Sphinx-based documentation, which allows easy, automated report generation, using e.g. CI, as can be seen in the [Kenning documentation](https://antmicro.github.io/kenning/sample-report.html).

While native frameworks are great for training and inference, model design, training on GPUs and distributing training across many devices, e.g. in a cloud environment, there is a fairly large variety of inference-focused frameworks for production purposes that focus on getting the most out of hardware in order to get results as fast as possible.

## Optimizing a model using TensorFlow Lite

One of such frameworks is TensorFlow Lite - a lightweight library for inferring networks on edge - it has a small binary size (which can be even more reduced by disabling unused operators) and a highly optimized format of input models, called FlatBuffers.

Before the TensorFlow Lite Interpreter (runtime for the TensorFlow Lite library) can be used, the model first needs to be optimized and compiled to the `.tflite` format.

Let's add a TensorFlow Lite Optimizer that will convert our MobileNetV2 model to a FlatBuffer format, as well as TensorFlow Lite Runtime that will execute the model:


```{literalinclude} ../scripts/jsonconfigs/mobilenetv2-tensorflow-tflite-f32.json
:language: json
:lines: 15-24
```

The configuration of the already existing blocks has not changed - the dataset will not be downloaded again though, since the files are already present.

The first new addition is the presence of the `optimizers` list - it allows us to add one or more objects inheriting from the `kenning.core.optimizer.Optimizer` class.
Optimizers read the model from the input file, apply various optimizations, and then save the optimized model to a new file.

In our current scenario, we will use the `TFLiteCompiler` class - it reads the model in a Keras-specific format, optimizes the model and saves it to the `./build/fp32.tflite` file.
The parameters of this particular Optimizer are worth noting here (each Optimizer usually has a different set of parameters):

* `target` - indicates what the desired target device (or model type) is, `default` is the regular CPU.
Another example here could be `edgetpu`, which can compile models for the Google Coral platform.
* `compiled_model_path` - indicates where the model should be saved.
* `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type` - indicate what the input and output type of the model should be.
Usually, all trained models use FP32 weights (32-bit floating point) and activations - using `float32` here keeps the weights unchanged.

The second thing that is added to the previous flow is the `runtime` block - it provides a class inheriting from the `kenning.core.runtime.Runtime` class that is able to load the final model and run inference on target hardware.
Usually, each `Optimizer` has a corresponding `Runtime` able to run its results.

To compile the scenario (called `tflite-fp32.json`), run:

```bash name=tflite-fp32
kenning optimize test report \
  --json-cfg scripts/jsonconfigs/mobilenetv2-tensorflow-tflite-f32.json \
  --measurements build/tflite-fp32.json \
  --report-path build/benchmarks/tflite-fp32.md
```

While it depends on the platform used, there should be a significant improvement in both inference time (model ca. 10-15x faster model compared to the native model) and memory usage (output model ca. 2x smaller).
Whatâ€™s worth noting is that we get a significant improvement with no harm to the quality of the model - the outputs stay the same.

![Confusion matrix](../img/confusion-matrix.*)

## Quantizing a model using TensorFlow Lite

To further reduce memory usage, we can quantize the model - it is a process where all weights and activations in a model are calibrated to work with low-precision floating-point or integer reporesentations (i.e. `INT8`), instead of the `FP32` precision.
While it may severely harm the quality of the predictions, the quality reduction can be negligible with proper calibration.

The model can be quantized during the compilation process in TensorFlow Lite.
With Kenning, it can be achieved with the following simple additions:

```{literalinclude} ../scripts/jsonconfigs/mobilenetv2-tensorflow-tflite-int8.json
:language: json
:lines: 15-24
```

The only changes here in comparison to the previous configuration appear in the `TFLiteCompiler` configuration - we change `target`, `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type` to `int8`.
Then, in the background, `TFLiteCompiler` fetches a subset of images from the `PetDataset` object to calibrate the model, and so the entire model calibration process happens automatically.

Let's run the above scenario (`tflite-int8.json`):

```bash name=tflite-int8
kenning optimize test report \
  --json-cfg scripts/jsonconfigs/mobilenetv2-tensorflow-tflite-int8.json \
  --measurements build/tflite-int8.json \
  --report-path build/benchmarks/tflite-int8.md
```

This results in a model over 7 times smaller compared to the native model without significant loss of accuracy, but without speed improvement.

## Speeding up inference with Apache TVM

To speed up inference of a quantized model, we can utilize vector extensions in x86 CPUs, more specifically AVX2.
For this, let's use the Apache TVM framework to compile efficient runtimes for various hardware platforms.
The scenario looks like this:

```{literalinclude} ../scripts/jsonconfigs/mobilenetv2-tensorflow-tvm-avx-int8.json
:language: json
:lines: 15-33
```

As it can be observed, addition of a new framework is just a matter of simply adding and configuring another optimizer and using the corresponding `Runtime` to the final `Optimizer`.

The `TVMCompiler`, with `llvm -mcpu=core-avx2` as the target, optimizes and compiles the model to use vector extensions.
The final result is a `.tar` file containing a shared library that implements the entire model.

Let's compile the scenario (`tvm-avx2-int8.json`):

```bash name=tvm-avx2-int8
kenning optimize test report \
  --json-cfg scripts/jsonconfigs/mobilenetv2-tensorflow-tvm-avx-int8.json \
  --measurements build/tvm-avx2-int8.json \
  --report-path build/benchmarks/tvm-avx2-int8.md
```

This results in a model over 40 times faster compared to the  native implementation, with size reduced 3x.

This shows how easily we can interconnect various frameworks and get the most out of the hardware using Kenning, while performing just minor alterations to the configuration file.

The summary of passes can be seen below:

|               | Speed boost | Accuracy     | Size reduction  |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| native        |           1 | 0.9572730984 |               1 |
| tflite-fp32   | 15.79405698 | 0.9572730984 |     1.965973551 |
| tflite-int8   | 1.683232669 | 0.9519662539 |      7.02033412 |
| tvm-avx2-int8 | 41.61514549 | 0.9487005035 |     3.229375069 |

## Automated model comparison

The `kenning.scenarios.render_report` script also allows us to compare evaluation results for multiple models.
Apart from creating a table with a summary of models, it also creates plots aggregating measurements collected during the evaluation process.

To create a comparison report for the above experiments, run:

```bash
kenning report \
    --report-path build/benchmarks/summary.md \
    --measurements \
        build/native.json \
        build/tflite-fp32.json \
        build/tflite-int8.json \
        build/tvm-avx2-int8.json
```
