ONNX support in deep learning frameworks
========================================

`ONNX <https://onnx.ai/>`_ is an open format created to represent machine learning models.
The ONNX format is frequently updated with new operators that are present in the state-of-the-art models.

This common format enables developers to use models in various frameworks, tools, runtimes and compilers.
Most of the existing frameworks for training, compiling and running provide conversion methods from and to an ONNX format.
